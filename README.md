# Machine Learning Lab Project: Credit Card Overdue Likelihood Prediction
## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing a machine learning project (as part of the machine learning lecture at the university of applied sciences Ulm) focused on predicting the likelihood of credit card payment delays. The project utilizes data from a Kaggle dataset and explores various machine learning techniques to address this real-world problem faced by financial institutions.
Repository Structure

- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for navigating the repository.
- `Lab Project Notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, model building, and evaluations.

## Data

The project uses two primary data sources:

- application_record.csv - Contains customer demographic and personal information.
- credit_record.csv - Includes customers' credit history.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

- Data Understanding: Analysis of the structure and quality of the data.
- Data Preparation: Cleaning, encoding, and merging datasets.
- Modeling: Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models, including Decision Trees, KNN, Ridge Regression, and Neural Networks.

## Installation

Instructions for setting up the project environment:

- Clone the repository.
- Install required Python packages: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.

## Usage

To use the project:

- Open the `Lab Project Notebook.ipynb` notebook.
- Run the cells to perform the analysis and view the results.
