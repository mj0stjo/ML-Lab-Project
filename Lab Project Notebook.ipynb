    "It is important for banks to know in advance whether or not a customer will repay their credit card bill on time in order to decide whether or not to give them a credit card. To do this, they try to make a prediction based on personal information. Therefore, they compare the current customer with historical data from other customers.\n",

    "Because credit scoring is a very complex task, it is very difficult to find a well performing model. An other problem is that a transparent and comprehensible model should be used so that customers understand the bank's decision. To find such a model is really hard in the world of machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "Overall, the dataset consists of two parts: the customer data and the credit data. The customer data mostly contains information about income, job, family situation and contact methods as these are important aspects for evaluating the creditworthiness. The credit data is basically a credit history overview, showing for a given custumer and month if the credit was paid back on time. This credit data can now be used for calculating an \"overdue_likelyhood\" for every customer which states how likely it is for this specific customer to not pay it's credit back in time. This is an important information for a credit institute. Based on all the findings in this section the two datasets can now be prepared, connected and finally used for training a machine learning model."
